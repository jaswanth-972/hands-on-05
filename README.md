A generic Heap class is implemented in Python in this project.

The Python implementation is compatible with:

Any type of data can be stored in this general heap structure, including floats, integers, and custom data structures.
the min-heap characteristic, which states that the root is always the smallest element.
Heap-based processes:
adding additional pieces to the heap.
The heap property is restored by popping the root element.
developing a min-heap from a random or unsorted array.
taking out the heap's root element without removing it.
